##INSTALL TENANTMLS FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT##

TenantMLS utilizes git, a subversioning and authoring system that makes everyones' lives a lot easier.
Git allows multiple developers to work together without the worry of overwriting files. All the server repos
have been setup and are ready for you to begin developing.

Getting started:
1)	Install git on your computer
	  * Instructions can be found at http://git-scm.com

2) Install and run LAMP/MAMP/WAMP
	* Makes your computer a local server for Apache, MySQL, and PHP
	* Gives you a suitable development environment
	* Access by going to http://localhost/
	* phpMyAdmin -> http://localhost/phpMyAdmin
	* PATH_TO_HTDOCS = path where program loads the web pages

3) Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
	$[terminal/cmd]#>	cd [PATH_TO_HTDOCS]
	$[terminal/cmd]#> 	git clone ssh://[username]@tenantmls.com/usr/git/tmls.git tmls
	$[terminal/cmd]#>	cd tmls

	Voila! You now how a local copy of TenantMLS.
	Go to http://localhost/tmls/framework to view your development site (won't work yet)

4) Import databases
	Import the file 'framework/db/tmls_framework.sql' into phpMyAdmin to create the dependent dbs

5) Configuration
	Create the file framework/config/serverconfig.php
	============================================================================================================
		define('DB_HOST','localhost');
		define('DB_USER','root');
		define('DB_PASSWORD','root');
		define('DB_NAME','tmls_framework');
		define('BASE_PATH','http://localhost:8888/tmls/framework');
		define ('DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT',true);
	============================================================================================================

6) Commit and Push (Save and Publish)
	Save your files as normal.

	"Commit" your changes often (files that have been saved) and leave well-explained comments on your edits
	Remember: If you mess it all up, you can always revisit a previous commit, so don't not do it!

	============================================================================================================
	Example:
	|	$[terminal/cmd]#>	git commit -m "[INSERT_YOUR_COMMENT_HERE]" -a
		(-a commits all files changed)
	============================================================================================================

	"Push" your changes when you are finished developing - making all changes public to the web server

	============================================================================================================
	Example:
	|	$[terminal/cmd]#>	git push
	============================================================================================================

	When you see your changes live, pat yourself on the back. You just made TenantMLS a lot nicer of a place.
