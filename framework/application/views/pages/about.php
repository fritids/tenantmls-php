					What is TenantMLS?
				</span>
				<span class="ui-pages-sub-text">
					TenantMLS is a free tenant multiple listing service that allows tenants looking for apartments, house rentals, sublets, shared space,
					roommates, vacation space or commercial space to share their information with prospective agents and compete in an open marketplace for
					available rentals. Tenant members register for free and create a profile, sharable on a public or private basis, in order to help them
					secure desirable housing accommodations.

					Why Do Tenants Become Members?
				</span>
				<span class="ui-pages-sub-text">
					TenantMLS gives tenants a real voice in the selection process, giving them a chance to compete for housing in a fair, easy and secure manner.
					Tenants will be able to allow multiple landlords to thoroughly "check them out" before moving in. Best of all, TenantMLS is absolutely free
					 - no hidden costs, strings attached or bogus trial periods.

					Why Do Real Estate Professionals Become Members?
				</span>
				<span class="ui-pages-sub-text">
					Using TenantMLS to network with landlords and fully profiled tenants is the ultimate vehicle to skyrocket their profits in the hottest market in
					real estate today - rentals. Using this site to brand themselves as rental experts has proven to be a very effective way to build a lucrative real
					estate practice.

					What Makes Us Radically Different From A Typical MLS?
				</span>
				<span class="ui-pages-sub-text">
					In a typical Multiple Listing Service (MLS), the commodities or inventory that is "listed" are residential, commercial or industrial properties placed
					on the market for sale, lease or exchange. An MLS fosters an open, competitive marketplace where the laws of supply and demand control the negotiated
					price that buyers and sellers can successfully attain to sell, rent or exchange their real property.<br /><br />

					At TenantMLS, our commodity is fully profiled, readily available residential, commercial or industrial TENANTS to fill any available residential, commercial
					or industrial properties for lease. Our listings are of REAL PEOPLE looking to rent, NOT REAL PROPERTY looking to be rented. TenantMLS fosters an open,
					competitive marketplace where the laws of supply and demand control the price tenants and landlords can successfully negotiate to rent real property.
